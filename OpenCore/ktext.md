# Gathering files

* Supported version: 0.5.7

This section is for gathering miscellaneous files for booting macOS, we do expect you to know your hardware well before starting and hopefully made a Hackintosh before as we won't be deep diving in here.

> What's the best way to figure out if my hardware is supported?

See the [**supported hardware section**](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Desktop-Guide/blob//master/extras/hardware.md) for some better insight into what macOS requires to boot, hardware support between Clover and OpenCore are quite similar.

## Firmware Drivers

These are the drivers used by OpenCore, for the majority of systems you only need 3 .efi drivers to get up and running:

* [ApfsDriverLoader.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases)
   * Needed for seeing APFS volumes(ie. macOS)
* [HfsPlus.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlus.efi) **or** [VboxHfs.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/AppleSupportPkg/releases)
   * Needed for seeing HFS volumes(ie. macOS Installers and Recovery partitions/images). **Do not mix HFS drivers**
* [OpenRuntime.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
  * Replacement for [AptioMemoryFix.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/AptioFixPkg), used as an extension for OpenCore to help with patching boot.efi for NVRAM fixes and better memory management.

For legacy users:

* [OpenUsbKbDxe.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
   * Used for OpenCore picker on **legacy systems running DuetPkg**, [not recommended and even harmful on UEFI(Ivy Bridge and newer)](https://applelife.ru/threads/opencore-obsuzhdenie-i-ustanovka.2944066/page-176#post-856653)
* [NvmExpressDxe.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
   * Used for Haswell and older when no NVMe driver is built into the firmware, not needed if you're not using an NVMe drive
* [XhciDxe.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
   * Used for Sandy Bridge and older when no XHCI driver is built into the firmware, not needed if you're not using a USB 3.0 expansion card
* [HfsPlusLegacy.efi](https://github.com/acidanthera/OcBinaryData/blob/master/Drivers/HfsPlusLegacy.efi)
   * Legacy variant of HfsPlus, used for systems that lack RDRAND instruction support. This is generally seen on Sandy Bridge and older

For a full list of compatible drivers, see 11.2 Properties in the [OpenCorePkg Docs](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Configuration.pdf). These files will go in your Drivers folder in your EFI

## Kexts

A kext is a **k**ernel **ext**ension, you can think of this as a driver for macOS, these files will go into the Kexts folder in your EFI

All kext listed below can be found **pre-compiled** in the [Kext Repo](http://kexts.goldfish64.com/). Kexts here are compiled each time there's a new commit.

**Must haves**:

* [VirtualSMC](https://github.com/acidanthera/VirtualSMC/releases)
  * Emulates the SMC chip found on real macs, without this macOS will not boot
  * Alternative is FakeSMC which can have better or worse support, most commonly used on legacy hardware.
* [Lilu](https://github.com/vit9696/Lilu/releases)
  * A kext to patch many processes, required for AppleALC and WhateverGreen and recommended for VirtualSMC

**VirtualSMC Plugins**:

* SMCProcessor.kext
  * Used for monitoring CPU temperature
* SMCSuperIO.kext
  * Used for monitoring fan speed
* SMCLightSensor.kext
  * Used for the ambient light sensor on laptops
  * Do not use if you don't have an ambient light sensor, can cause issues otherwise
* SMCBatteryManager.kext
  * Used for measuring battery readouts on laptops
  * Do not use until battery has been properly patched, can cause issues otherwise

**Graphics**:

* [WhateverGreen](https://github.com/acidanthera/WhateverGreen/releases)
  * Used for graphics patching DRM, boardID, framebuffer fixes, etc, all GPUs benefit from this kext.
  * Note the SSDT-PNLF.dsl file included is only required for laptops and AIOs, see * [Getting started with ACPI](/extras/acpi.md) for more info

**Audio**:

* [AppleALC](https://github.com/vit9696/AppleALC/releases)
  * Used for AppleHDA patching, used for giving you onboard audio. AMD 15h/16h may have issues with this and Ryzen/Threadripper systems rarely have mic support

**Ethernet**:

* [IntelMausiEthernet](https://github.com/Mieze/IntelMausiEthernet)
  * Required for Intel NICs, chipsets that are based off of I211-AT will need the SmallTreeIntel82576 kext
* [AtherosE2200Ethernet](https://github.com/Mieze/AtherosE2200Ethernet/releases)
  * Required for Atheros and Killer NICs
* [RealtekRTL8111](https://github.com/Mieze/RTL8111_driver_for_OS_X/releases)
  * Required for Realtek NICs

**USB**:

* [USBInjectAll](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-usb-inject-all/downloads/)
  * Used for injecting Intel USB controllers on systems without defined USB ports in ACPI
  * Not needed on Skylake and newer 

**WiFi and Bluetooth**:

* [AirportBrcmFixup](https://github.com/acidanthera/AirportBrcmFixup/releases)
  * Used for patching non-Apple Broadcom cards, **will not work on intel, Killer, Realtek, etc**
* [BrcmPatchRAM](https://github.com/acidanthera/BrcmPatchRAM/releases)
  * Used for uploading firmware on Broadcom bluetooth chipset, required for all non-Apple/Fenvi Airport cards.
  * To be paired with BrcmFirmwareData.kext
    * BrcmPatchRAM3 for 10.14+ (must be paired with BrcmBluetoothInjector)
    * BrcmPatchRAM2 for 10.11-10.14
    * BrcmPatchRAM for 10.10 or older
    
The order in `Kernel -> Add` should be: 

1. BrcmBluetoothInjector 
2. BrcmFirmwareData 
3. BrcmPatchRAM3

**Extra's**:

* [VoodooTSCSync](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/VoodooTSCSync/downloads/)
   * Needed for syncing TSC on some of Intel's HEDT and server motherboards, without this macOS may be extremely slow or even unbootable. Skylake-X should use TSCAdjustReset instead
* [NVMeFix](https://github.com/acidanthera/NVMeFix/releases)
   * Used for fixing power management and initialization on non-Apple NVMe, requires macOS 10.14 or newer

**Laptop Specifics**:

* [VoodooPS2](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooPS2/releases)
   * Required for systems with PS2 keyboards and trackpads
   * Trackpad users should also pair this with [VoodooInput](https://github.com/acidanthera/VoodooInput/releases)(This must come before VoodooPS2 in your config.plist)

* [VoodooI2C](https://github.com/alexandred/VoodooI2C/releases) 
   * Used for fixing I2C devices, found with some fancier touchpads and touchscreen machines
   * To be paired with a plugin:
      * VoodooI2CHID - Implements the Microsoft HID device specification.
      * VoodooI2CElan - Implements support for Elan proprietary devices. (does not work on ELAN1200+, use the HID instead)
      * VoodooI2CSynaptics - Implements support for Synaptic's proprietary devices.
      * VoodooI2CFTE - Implements support for the FTE1001 touchpad.
      * VoodooI2CUPDDEngine - Implements Touchbase driver support.

To figure out what kind of keyboard and trackpad you have, check DeviceManager in Windows or `dmesg |grep input` in Linux

* [NoTouchID](https://github.com/al3xtjames/NoTouchID/releases)
   * Recommended for SMBIOS that include a TouchID sensor to fix auth issues
 

Please refer to [Kexts.md](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/blob/master/Docs/Kexts.md) for a full list of supported kexts

## SSDTs

So you see all those SSDTs in the AcpiSamples folder and wonder whether you need any of them. For us, we will be going over what SSDTs you need in **your specific ACPI section of the config.plist**, as the SSDTs you need are platform specific. With some even system specific where they need to be configured and you can easily get lost if I give you a list of SSDTs to choose from now. 

[Getting started with ACPI](/extras/acpi.md) has an extended section on SSDTs including compiling them on different platforms.
