So you want to hackintosh a laptop? Willing to spend ~~hours~~ days troubleshooting various parts of your laptop? Well, here's the vanila laptop guide for you. This guide will explain everything you need to know to hackintosh a laptop. This is **not** a quick way to get a cheap MacBook - this should only be seen as a hobby project and never relied on unless you completely understannd what you're doing *and* know how to fix things when things break. If you need a daily driver MacBook, we recommend looking elsewhere like the used market on eBay, Facebook, etc. For those who are either masochists, want a challenge, or want to see how far you can get, this guide is for you!

## Before you begin

### **KNOW YOUR HARDWARE**

We can't stress this enough. If you don't know your hardware and don't know how to find it, hackintoshing probably isn't for you. Device Manager, [Speccy](https://www.ccleaner.com/speccy) and google are your friends here.

### **READ TWICE AND CAREFULLY BEFORE ASKING**

This is not a very welcoming community for people who do not want to do some self-study and learn from other's findings and instead wait for someone to spoon-feed them information and make things work for them. Read The Fucking Manual and work your way through it and do some intense googling.

## Process
1. [Making macOS installer (either through the offline or online installer)](/preparations/installer-overview.html)
2. [Install OpenCore bootloader](/preparations/opencore-efi.html)
3. [Gathering Kexts/Drivers](/OpenCore/ktext.html)
4. [Modifying ACPI](https://dortanian.github.io/Getting-Started-With-ACPI/)
5. [Configuring OpenCore](/OpenCore/config.html)
6. [Installation](/installation/installation-process.html)
7. [Post-Install](/post-install/)
  * Audio
  * Installing bootloader to hard drive
  * Power Management
  * Security/FileVault
  * Etc.

If you're ready, go to the next page.

Good Luck! ðŸŽŠ
