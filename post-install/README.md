# Post Install

* Supported version: 0.5.8

You've finally finished installing macOS on the internal drive.
Congratulations!

There are still some things to clean up. They include:

1. [Post Install steps](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/post-install/) from the
[OpenCore Desktop Guide.](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Desktop-Guide/)
(We list those tasks only in the sister guide to prevent duplication.)

2. [Fixing Battery Status](./post-install/battery.md) Since desktop computers don't rely on a battery,
the Desktop Guide doesn't describe patching the battery status.
